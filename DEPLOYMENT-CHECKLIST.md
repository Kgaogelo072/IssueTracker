- [ ] JWT authentication works end-to-end
- [ ] Data persists between sessions

## üîß Configuration Verification

### Azure App Service Settings
- [ ] Connection string is set correctly
- [ ] JWT settings are configured
- [ ] Environment is set to Production
- [ ] HTTPS-only is enabled
- [ ] Always-on is enabled

### CORS Configuration
- [ ] Frontend domain is in allowed origins
- [ ] Development domain is in allowed origins
- [ ] Credentials are allowed

### Database Configuration
- [ ] Connection string is valid
- [ ] Firewall rules allow Azure services
- [ ] Database is accessible from App Service

## üìä Monitoring Setup

### Application Insights (Optional)
- [ ] Application Insights resource created
- [ ] Instrumentation key configured
- [ ] Logs are being collected
- [ ] Performance metrics are visible

### Alerts (Optional)
- [ ] CPU usage alerts configured
- [ ] Memory usage alerts configured
- [ ] Error rate alerts configured
- [ ] Response time alerts configured

## üîí Security Verification

### Authentication
- [ ] JWT tokens are properly signed
- [ ] Token expiration is reasonable
- [ ] Password hashing is working
- [ ] User sessions are secure

### Network Security
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced
- [ ] SQL Server firewall is configured
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Environment variables are secure

## üö® Troubleshooting Common Issues

### If API deployment fails:
1. Check Azure CLI login: `az account show`
2. Verify resource group exists: `az group show --name rg-issuetracker`
3. Check .NET version: `dotnet --version`
4. Verify build works locally: `dotnet build`

### If Frontend deployment fails:
1. Check Node.js version: `node --version`
2. Verify npm install works: `npm install`
3. Check build works locally: `npm run build`
4. Verify Azure CLI access to Static Web Apps

### If database connection fails:
1. Check connection string in App Service settings
2. Verify SQL Server firewall rules
3. Test connection from Azure portal
4. Check database exists and is accessible

### If CORS errors occur:
1. Verify frontend URL in CORS configuration
2. Check Program.cs CORS settings
3. Restart App Service after CORS changes
4. Clear browser cache

## üìà Performance Optimization

### After successful deployment:
- [ ] Monitor response times
- [ ] Check memory usage
- [ ] Optimize database queries if needed
- [ ] Consider scaling up if usage increases
- [ ] Set up automated backups

## üìù Documentation

### Update these files after deployment:
- [ ] README.md with production URLs
- [ ] Environment configuration files
- [ ] Deployment scripts if needed
- [ ] Team documentation
